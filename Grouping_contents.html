	<h3>p element</h3>
	<p> The p element represents a paragraph.</p>

	<h3>hr element</h3>
	<p>The hr element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g. a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book.</p>

	<h3>pre element</h3>
	<p>The pre element represents a block of preformatted text, in which structure is represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements.It preserves both the spaces and line breaks.</p>

	<h3>blockquote element</h3>
	<p>The blockquote element represents a section that is quoted from another source.</p>

	<h3>ol element</h3>
	<p>The ol element represents a list of items, where the items have been intentionally ordered, such that changing the order would change the meaning of the document.</p>

	<h3>ul element</h3>
	<p>The ul element represents a list of items, where the order of the items is not important â€” that is, where changing the order would not materially change the meaning of the document.</p>

	<h3>menu element</h3>
	<p>The menu element represents a toolbar consisting of its contents, in the form of an unordered list of items (represented by li elements), each of which represents a command that the user can perform or activate.</p>

	<h3>li element</h3>
	<p>The li element represents a list item. If its parent element is an ol, ul, or menu element, then the element is an item of the parent element's list, as defined for those elements. Otherwise, the list item has no defined list-related relationship to any other li element.</p>

	<h3>dl element</h3>
	<p>The dl element represents an association list consisting of zero or more name-value groups (a description list). A name-value group consists of one or more names (dt elements, possibly as children of a div element child) followed by one or more values (dd elements, possibly as children of a div element child), ignoring any nodes other than dt and dd element children, and dt and dd elements that are children of div element children. Within a single dl element, there should not be more than one dt element for each name.</p>

	<h3>dt element</h3>
	<p>The dt element represents the term, or name, part of a term-description group in a description list (dl element).</p>

	<h3>dd element</h3>
	<p>The dd element represents the description, definition, or value, part of a term-description group in a description list (dl element).</p>

	<h3>figure element</h3>
	<p>The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained (like a complete sentence) and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.</p>

	<h3>figcaption element</h3>
	<p>The figcaption element represents a caption or legend for the rest of the contents of the figcaption element's parent figure element, if any.</p>

	<h3>main element</h3>
	<p>The main element represents the dominant contents of the document.</p>

	<h3>div element</h3>
	<p>The div element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the class, lang, and title attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements. It can also be used in a dl element, wrapping groups of dt and dd elements.</p>
