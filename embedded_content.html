	<h2>audio</h2>
	<p>An audio element represents a sound or audio stream.
	The src, preload, autoplay, mediagroup, loop, muted, and controls attributes are the attributes common to all media elements.</p>

	<h2>canvas</h2>
	<p>The canvas element provides scripts with a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly.</p>

	<h2>embed</h2>
	<p>The embed element represents an integration point for an external (typically non-HTML) application or interactive content.</p>

	<h2>iframe</h2>
	<p>The src attribute gives the address of a page that the nested browsing context is to contain. The attribute, if present, must be a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces.

		Attributes<br>
	<pre>

	srcdoc

	seamless
	width
	height
	</pre>
	</p>

	<h2>img</h2>
	<p>An img element represents an image.<br>

	The image given by the src attribute is the embedded content; the value of the alt attribute provides equivalent content for those who cannot process images or who have image loading disabled.<br>

	The src attribute must be present, and must contain a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces referencing a non-interactive, optionally animated, image resource that is neither paged nor scripted.<br>
	Attributes<br>
	<pre>
	alt
	src
	usemap
	ismap
	width
	height
	</pre>
	</p>

	<h2>object</h2>
	<p>The object element can represent an external resource, which, depending on the type of the resource, will either be treated as an image, as a nested browsing context, or as an external resource to be processed by a plugin.</p>

	<h2>svg</h2>
	<p>The SVG specification includes requirements regarding the handling of elements in the DOM that are not in the SVG namespace, that are in SVG fragments, and that are not included in a foreignObject element. This specification does not define any processing for elements in SVG fragments that are not in the HTML namespace; they are considered neither conforming nor non-conforming from the perspective of this specification.</p>
	
	<h2>video</h2>
	<p>A video element is used for playing videos or movies, and audio files with captions.
<br>
	Content may be provided inside the video element; it is intended for older Web browsers which do not support video, so that legacy video plugins can be tried, or to show text to the users of these older browsers informing them of how to access the video contents.<br>
